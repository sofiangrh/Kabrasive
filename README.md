# Description
Kabrasive is a mod of QflashingLights (which itself is based on qDrk by Luxie Rayku) with nice highlights to finish combined with a modded version of the buttons of Royale VSQ.

The whole reason was to create window borders that are small and beautiful combined with some of the best buttons available.

This goes well with any dark/steel blue theme, but was designed with http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/QflashingLights+%28GTK%29?content=129600 QflashingLights (GTK) in mind.

Enjoy!
